Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in Racine, Wisconsin.[15] It induced the state of Wisconsin in 1875 to offer a US$10,000 (equivalent to $266,485 in 2022) award to the first to produce a substitute for the use of horses and other animals. </b></font>

	<h1>HISTORY OF CARS </h1>
	<p1><font color ="	#FF4500" face="Verdana" size="4"><i>Steam-powered road vehicles, both cars and wagons, reached the peak of their development in the early 1930s with fast-steaming lightweight boilers and efficient engine designs. Internal combustion engines also developed greatly during World War I, becoming simpler to operate and more reliable.

	<h2>HISTORY OF CARS CONTINUED</h2>
	<p2><font size="5"><u>whether steam cars will ever be reborn in later technological eras remains to be seen. Magazines such as Light Steam Power continued to describe them into the 1980s. The 1950s saw interest in steam-turbine cars powered by small nuclear reactors[19] (this was also true of aircraft), but the fears about the dangers inherent in nuclear fission technology soon killed these ideas.
